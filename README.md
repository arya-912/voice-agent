# razorcovery

Hinglish Voice Recovery Agent — Razorpay AI Buildathon, Track 03.
See `PRD.md` for scope, `CLAUDE.md` for working rules.

## Status

- [x] Synthetic failure-event generator (3 failure types, 50+ events)
- [x] Append-only audit trail (Postgres)
- [x] Decision layer: one logged function per failure type + stopping rules
- [x] Tests: stopping rules provably block calls
- [x] LiveKit Hinglish voice agent — first pass (Gemini Live)
- [x] Metrics view — FastAPI + one HTML page, computed from the audit trail
- [x] Merchant intake — upload a contact sheet, run the recovery batch,
      watch it live, download the results
- [x] Real outbound calls — Vobiz SIP trunk via LiveKit (verified: live PSTN
      call placed and answered)
- [x] Accounts (email + password) gating the web app
- [x] Editable agent prompt (`/settings`) — persona/tone/flow customisable
      per workspace; compliance guardrails always appended, not editable
- [x] Sample sheet download on `/upload`
- [x] Client website (`client-demo/`) live demo: visitors talk to the real
      recovery agent from the browser mic (no phone dialled)
- [ ] Recording playback (wired; needs an S3 bucket)
- [ ] Day-3 live pilot with a real merchant

## Setup

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env          # fill DATABASE_URL, GOOGLE_API_KEY, LIVEKIT_*
```

Postgres (local alternative to RDS, one-time, as a superuser):

```sql
CREATE ROLE razorcovery WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'devpass';
CREATE DATABASE razorcovery OWNER razorcovery;
```

## Run

```bash
python -m audit.db                     # create the audit_log schema
uvicorn metrics.app:app --port 8000    # open http://localhost:8000, create an account
pytest -q                              # ~110 tests (DB ones skip without Postgres)
```

First run: `/login` shows "create the first account". Every page requires
sign-in (email + password, bcrypt, Postgres-backed sessions). There is **no
synthetic/seeded data** — the dashboard starts empty and fills only from real
use. `python -m metrics.seed --wipe` clears everything back to empty.

Drive it from a real sheet: `/upload` → upload a CSV/XLSX of contacts → tick
the consent attestation → run the batch → watch it live at `/batch/{id}` →
download the results. With telephony configured (below) voice rows place real
calls; without it they're marked `skipped` — nothing is faked.

The dashboard filters by failure type, intervention, status, date range and
batch (`/?failure_type=payment_retry&status=recovered`); same params on the
JSON endpoints. LLM cost is real token usage (LiveKit `UsageCollector`) priced
at Gemini list price; telephony is ₹0 until a per-minute rate is set.

## Layout

```
data/       synthetic event generator (test fixtures only, not the app)
decision/   failure-type -> intervention routing, stopping rules
audit/      append-only Postgres audit log (schema, writer, reader, export)
voice/      Gemini agent, Hinglish prompt, SIP dialer, recording, setup/test
auth/       accounts + sessions (bcrypt, Postgres), login middleware
intake/     merchant sheet -> parse (CSV/XLSX) -> batch/batch_row -> real calls
metrics/    FastAPI web app: auth + dashboard + call logs + intake
tests/
```

## Decision model

| failure type          | rule summary                                                       |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| payment_retry         | amount-tiered: >=1500 voice, >=400 SMS, else retry link            |
| checkout_abandonment  | higher voice bar (>=3000), else SMS / link                         |
| mandate_failure       | `mandate_revoked` -> link only (needs re-auth); else amount-tiered |

Stopping rules (`decision/config.py`, enforced in `decision/stopping_rules.py`,
re-checked at dispatch and again in the agent entrypoint):

- **explicit refusal** -> blocks every channel, logged
- **max 2 voice attempts** per customer -> blocks further calls (downgrades to SMS)
- **call window 09:00-19:00** in the customer's own timezone -> blocks calls outside it

## Audit trail

Every event: `event_ingested -> [stopping_rule_triggered?] -> decision`.
A placed call adds `action -> [stopping_rule_triggered if refused mid-call] -> outcome`,
with the transcript stored in the `outcome` row's payload. `audit_log` is
append-only (DB trigger rejects UPDATE/DELETE); metrics derive from it only.

## Voice pipeline

Gemini Live (`gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-12-2025`) via
`livekit-plugins-google` — one model for STT+LLM+TTS, handles Hindi/English
code-switching, with input+output audio transcription so both sides of the
call are captured. The conversation is a `voice/flow.py` `Agent` whose real actions
are function tools (`send_retry_link`, `mark_do_not_contact`, `wrong_person`,
`offer_declined`, `end_call`) — the model's speech never moves state, only the
logged tools do. The prompt forbids asking for card/CVV/OTP/UPI PIN and requires
honouring a hard "don't contact me again" immediately.

Telephony: `voice/dialer.py` has a real `LiveKitSipDialer` and `voice/agent.py`
rings the callee in with `create_sip_participant`. It activates when
`LIVEKIT_*` + `SIP_OUTBOUND_TRUNK_ID` are set. Until then `UnconfiguredDialer`
runs and voice rows are marked `skipped` (no fake conversation).

Wiring it up (one-time):

```bash
# 1. register your SIP provider as a LiveKit outbound trunk
python -m voice.setup_trunk --address <sip-host> --number +91XXXXXXXXXX \
    --user <sip-user> --password <sip-pass>          # prints SIP_OUTBOUND_TRUNK_ID
# 2. paste that + LIVEKIT_* into .env, then run the worker
python -m voice.agent start
# 3. test one call to a number you control
python -m voice.testcall --to +9198XXXXXXXX --amount 2499
```

Once the worker is up, the intake batch runner dispatches real calls to it
automatically for every voice-routed row.

## Merchant intake workflow

`intake/` — a merchant uploads a contact sheet and the recovery batch runs
against it. No hardcoded values; every number on the batch and dashboard is
computed from `audit_log`.

- `GET /upload` — CSV or XLSX. Columns are auto-detected (`intake/parse.py`:
  fuzzy header match, `+91` phone normalisation, dedup). A required consent
  attestation gates the run (PRD §1a: merchant's own customers only).
- Preview shows valid rows + every rejected row *with the reason* — nothing
  is silently dropped.
- `POST /upload` (attested) creates a `batch` + one `batch_row` per contact.
- `POST /batch/{id}/run` spawns `python -m intake.run_batch <id>` (subprocess:
  LiveKit plugins need the process main thread). Per row: build a real
  `FailureEvent` → `decision.route` → place a real call (telephony configured)
  or mark `skipped` → audit rows tagged `payload.batch_id`.
- `GET /batch/{id}` — live progress bar + records table (polls
  `/batch/{id}/progress`). `GET /batch/{id}/stream` is the SSE feed.
- `GET /batch/{id}/export.csv` / `.json` — per-row decision + outcome +
  transcript. `GET /?batch=<id>` slices the whole dashboard to that batch.
- `GET /batches` — all batches.

## Web app

`metrics/` — FastAPI, accounts required (`auth/`). Server-rendered HTML +
Tailwind CDN; fixed sidebar (Dashboard / Call logs / Upload sheet / Batches /
Agent prompt), stat cards, white panels, empty states. All numbers computed
from `audit_log` at request time (`metrics/compute.py`) — nothing seeded.

- `GET /` — recovery rate + ₹ recovered by intervention and by failure type;
  real LLM cost per recovery (token usage × Gemini list price); stopping-rule
  counts; the full exceptions list (every non-recovered event + why); all events.
- `GET /calls` — every outbound voice call: time, number, duration, result,
  ₹ cost, links to the recording + transcript.
- `GET /event/{id}` — drill-down: event facts → decision + reason → stopping
  rules → recording player → transcript → full audit timeline.
- `GET /settings` — the agent's persona/tone/call-flow is editable per
  workspace (`voice/agent_prompt.py`, one row, no multi-tenant); the
  no-card/OTP + hard-refusal guardrails are a fixed block always appended
  after the editable text, and are also enforced structurally by the call
  flow's tools (`voice/flow.py`) — editing the wording can't disable them.
  `/upload` has a "Download a sample sheet" link showing the expected columns.
- `GET /api/summary`, `/api/exceptions`, `/api/calls`, `/api/event/{id}` — JSON.
- `GET /login`, `/signup`, `POST /logout`.

## Website live demo

`client-demo/` (Next.js) is the public website. Its `/demo` page can put a
visitor on a live call with the real agent through their browser mic.
`metrics/demo_api.py` (the only public JSON routes, off unless
`DEMO_ENABLED=true`) + `voice/demo.py`:

- `POST /api/demo/session {"scenario_id": "payment_retry"}` → builds a
  fictional `demo_…` event, creates a LiveKit room, dispatches the worker
  with `dial=false, demo=true`, returns a 10-minute token for that room only.
- `GET /api/demo/session/{id}` → `pending` or `ended` + the outcome row.
- `POST /api/demo/session/{id}/end` → closes the room.

Never takes a phone number. Per-IP hourly limit (`DEMO_RATE_LIMIT_PER_HOUR`),
concurrency cap (`DEMO_MAX_CONCURRENT`), CORS limited to
`DEMO_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`. In the worker, demo calls skip the customer
stopping rules (the visitor started the call; there's no customer to
protect) and recording, are capped at 3 minutes, and publish tool calls +
the outcome to the room. They're audited like any call under `demo_` ids,
which the dashboard hides.

```bash
DEMO_ENABLED=true uvicorn metrics.app:app --port 8000
python -m voice.agent start
cd client-demo && NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000 npm run dev
```
